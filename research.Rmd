I am a PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Statistical Learning Group](https://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) at University of Pittsburgh, my research interests include High-dimensional Statistics, Statistical Genetics, Meta-analysis and Subgroup Analysis.

### On-Going Projects
* Sparse signal detection via restricted AW-Fisher's method.  
* Subject classification model utilizing single cell RNA sequenceing data.
* Detecting DE features in multiomics data using
AW-Fisher's method.
