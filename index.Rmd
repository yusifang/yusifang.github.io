<br>
Hello everyone, my name is Yusi Fang. I recently obtained my PhD degree in Biostatistics at [School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/), University of Pittsburgh under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) and [Dr. Zhao Ren](http://www.pitt.edu/~zren/). During my PhD studies, I am also a graduate student researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Anda M. Vlad](https://mageewomens.org/investigator/anda-m-vlad-md-ph-d) at Magee-Women's Research Institute. Prior to attending the PhD program, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.xmu.edu.cn/en/), Xiamen University.  

My research interest lies in developing and applying statistical methods to solve real biomedical problems. My methodological research spans meta-analysis of heterogeneous signals, large-scale inference, high-dimensional mediation analysis, and unsupervised learning for omics study. On the application side, I have collaborated with researchers in the fields of cancer and psychiatry to analyze a broad range of genomic (e.g., RNAseq data) and clinical (e.g., cancer registry) data.
